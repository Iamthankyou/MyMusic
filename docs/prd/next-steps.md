# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Create a concise UI/UX specification for the MyMusic Android app using the PRD. Focus on high-level flows and core screens: Trending, Feeds, Radio, Stream, Explore, Player, Downloads, and Details. Outline navigation model (bottom nav vs tabs), mini-player behavior, loading/error states, and visual style guidelines (Material 3, dynamic color)."

## Architect Prompt
"Create a full-stack (client) architecture for the MyMusic Android app per this PRD: Kotlin-only, Jetpack Compose UI, Hilt DI, MVVM + Clean Architecture, Jamendo API integration, Paging 3, Media3 playback service, and DownloadManager/MediaStore downloads. Provide module structure, DI graph, network stack, repository/use case design, media service design, and navigation."
