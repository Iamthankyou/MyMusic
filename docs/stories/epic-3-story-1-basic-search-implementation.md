# Story 3.1 — Basic Search Implementation (Epic 3: Discovery & Search)

## Status
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Basic Search Implementation implemented

## Story
As a music listener,
I want to search for tracks and artists by name,
so that I can quickly find specific music I want to listen to.

## Scope
- Search by track title and artist name
- Real-time search suggestions as user types
- Search results display with track information
- Basic filtering (sort by relevance, popularity, date)
- Integration with existing playback system

## Out of Scope
- Advanced filters (duration, year, genre)
- Search history management
- Search by lyrics or tags
- Voice search

- [Jetcaster Search UI Patterns](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/tree/main/Jetcaster)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can enter search query in search bar
2. Real-time suggestions appear as user types (minimum 2 characters)
3. Search results display track list with artwork, title, artist
4. User can tap on search result to play track
5. Search results can be sorted by relevance, popularity, date
6. Empty state shown when no results found
7. Loading state shown during search
8. Error handling for network issues

## Tasks (Suggested Breakdown)
- **Data Layer**
  - Create SearchRepository with Jamendo API integration
  - Add search endpoints to JamendoTracksService
  - Create SearchResult data model
  - Implement search caching for performance

- **Domain Layer**
  - Create SearchUseCase for search operations
  - Add search state management
  - Implement search result mapping

- **UI Layer**
  - Create SearchScreen with search bar
  - Implement real-time search suggestions
  - Create SearchResultsScreen with track list
  - Add search to bottom navigation
  - Implement loading and error states

- **Integration**
  - Connect search results to PlaybackController
  - Add search navigation to existing nav graph
  - Integrate with existing theme and components

## Definition of Done
- ✅ Search functionality works with Jamendo API
- ✅ Real-time suggestions implemented
- ✅ Search results display correctly
- ✅ Integration with playback system working
- ✅ Loading and error states handled
- ✅ UI follows Jetcaster design patterns
- ⏳ Basic sorting options available (future enhancement)
- ⏳ Unit tests for search logic (future enhancement)
- ⏳ UI tests for search flow (future enhancement)

## Implementation Summary
- ✅ **SearchRepository**: Created with Jamendo API integration
- ✅ **SearchUseCase**: Implemented for search operations
- ✅ **SearchViewModel**: Created with debounced search and state management
- ✅ **SearchScreen**: Implemented with SearchBar and results display
- ✅ **TrackItem Component**: Created for displaying search results
- ✅ **Navigation**: Added search tab to bottom navigation
- ✅ **DI Integration**: Added SearchRepository to dependency injection
- ✅ **API Integration**: Added search endpoint to JamendoTracksService

## Files Created/Modified
- `data/remote/JamendoTracksService.kt` - Added searchTracks endpoint
- `data/repository/SearchRepository.kt` - Created search repository
- `domain/usecase/SearchUseCase.kt` - Created search use case
- `presentation/search/SearchViewModel.kt` - Created search view model
- `presentation/search/SearchScreen.kt` - Created search screen
- `presentation/components/TrackItem.kt` - Created track item component
- `presentation/navigation/BottomNav.kt` - Added search tab
- `presentation/navigation/NavGraph.kt` - Created navigation graph
- `di/RepositoryModule.kt` - Added SearchRepository to DI
- `MainActivity.kt` - Updated to use NavGraph

## Technical Notes
- Use Compose SearchBar component for search input
- Implement debouncing for search suggestions (300ms delay)
- Cache search results for 5 minutes
- Use LazyColumn for search results with pagination
- Follow existing architecture patterns (Repository, UseCase, ViewModel)

## Files to Create/Modify
- `data/repository/SearchRepository.kt`
- `data/remote/JamendoTracksService.kt` (add search endpoints)
- `domain/usecase/SearchUseCase.kt`
- `domain/model/SearchResult.kt`
- `presentation/search/SearchScreen.kt`
- `presentation/search/SearchViewModel.kt`
- `presentation/search/SearchResultsScreen.kt`
