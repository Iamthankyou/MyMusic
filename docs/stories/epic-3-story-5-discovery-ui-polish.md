# Story 3.5 â€” Discovery UI Polish (Epic 3: Discovery & Search)

## Status
- ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED** - Ready for development

## Story
As a music listener,
I want a beautiful and smooth user experience when discovering music,
so that I can enjoy the process of finding new music.

## Scope
- Jetcaster-inspired design implementation
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessibility improvements (screen readers, navigation)
- Performance optimizations
- Dark/light theme support
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Out of Scope
- Advanced animations (complex gestures, 3D effects)
- Custom theme creation
- Advanced accessibility features
- Performance profiling tools

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All screens follow Jetcaster design patterns
2. Smooth animations for page transitions and content loading
3. Accessibility features work with screen readers
4. Performance is optimized for smooth scrolling
5. Dark and light themes are properly implemented
6. Loading states show skeleton screens
7. Error states display user-friendly messages
8. All interactive elements have proper touch targets
